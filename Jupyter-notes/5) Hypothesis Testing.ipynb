    "* 🧪 What is Hypothesis Testing in Data Science?\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used in data science to make inferences or decisions about a population based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps you answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is this new marketing strategy better than the old one?\"\n",
    "\"Does this drug actually improve recovery?\"\n",
    "\"Is the mean user rating really above 4.0?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 The Core Idea\n",
    "You start with two competing hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀):\n",
    "A default statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"There is no difference between the means of group A and group B.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):\n",
    "What you want to test or prove — that there is a difference or effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Group A has a higher mean than group B.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "🧮 Basic Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Formulate Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "H₀: No change, no effect\n",
    "\n",
    "H₁: There is a change or effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Significance Level (α)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common values: 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the probability of rejecting H₀ when it's actually true (Type I error)\n",

    "T-test: Comparing means\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square test: Comparing categories\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA: Comparing means across multiple groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test: Similar to t-test, used for large samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting your observed result (or more extreme) assuming H₀ is true\n",
    "\n",
    "Make Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value ≤ α → Reject H₀ → There is statistically significant evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value > α → Fail to reject H₀ → Not enough evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "🧑‍💻 Real Example (A/B Testing):\n",
    "Goal: You launch a new website layout (B) and want to see if it increases conversion compared to the old one (A).\n",
    "\n",
    "H₀: Conversion rate of A = B\n",
    "\n",
    "H₁: Conversion rate of B > A\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a proportion z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value < 0.05, you conclude layout B is better\n",
